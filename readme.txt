== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin delete existing comments? =

No, this plugin does not delete any existing comments from your database. It simply hides them from displaying and prevents new comments from being submitted.

= Can I configure which features to disable? =

This plugin is designed to be simple and lightweight with no configuration options. It disables all comment functionality when activated.

= Does this work with custom post types? =

Yes, this plugin disables comments for all post types, including custom post types.

= Does this work with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite installations and will work on individual sites or network-wide.

= Does this disable Gutenberg comment blocks? =

Yes, the plugin disables all 15 comment-related Gutenberg blocks, preventing them from being inserted in the block editor.

= Does this block comments via REST API? =

Yes, the plugin disables comment endpoints in the WordPress REST API and prevents comment insertion via API requests.

= Does this plugin automatically replace the previous "Disable Comments" plugin from WordPress.org? =

Yes, this plugin will automatically replace the original open-source [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) plugin if you overwrite the old plugin folder with this one. This works because both plugins use the same folder name (`disable-comments`) and main PHP file. No reactivation is required after replacing the filesâ€”just copy over the new files and the updated plugin will be used immediately.

Please note, however, that any options or settings saved by the previous plugin are not removed during this process.
